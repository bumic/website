Every day we rely more and more on technology to solve the world's problems; therefore I believe its crucial for everyone to know what is it capable of, where is it going, and ask ourselves where do we want it to go. I am particularly passionate about Reinforcement Learning, as it involves more ethical questions like its application on self-driving cars.",
